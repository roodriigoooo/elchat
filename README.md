## Overview

Using rasaAPI to create a chatbot that is able to:

- **Process a Knowledge Base**: Extract content from PDFs, text files, images, and soon, videos (for audio transcription), then index it for search. 
- **Respond Accurately**: Use NLU and dialogue management to answer customer questions based on the knowledge base. 
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Escalate to a human agent when unsure or when needed. 
- **Lead Generation and Automation**: Collect user data and integrate with external systems. 

Working on:

- Allow content to be edited in a WYSIWYG manner post-processing and indexing. 
- Optimize and develop indexing and storing of both knowledge base documents and questions processed through vector embeddings. 
- A graph-driven set of relationships and labels for later analysis. 
- Versioning and partitioning of knowledge base documents.
